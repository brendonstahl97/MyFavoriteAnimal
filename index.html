    <p>The Kakapo is a bird native to the island nation New Zealand. It is very similar to the Kiwi in that it is flightless, its feathers are fur-like, and it is extremely endangered. The Kakapo evolved with no natural predators on the islands. When humans brought animals such as dogs and cats to the islands, they nearly wiped out the entire population because the birds had no defense mechanisms to protect itself.</p>
